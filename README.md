Topic: MI classification using neural networks.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a collaborative system that detects the intention of brain signals to interact with the environment to achieve any objective such as movements. Many assistive technologies based on BCI systems are being developed to support physically challenged individuals, but the classification task to identify the brain signal with reasonably high accuracy is a challenge. In this study, we evaluate different neural network architectures including regular neural network *[RegularNeuralNetwork](./Reg_NN), convolutional neural network, residual neural network, MobileNet, and InceptionNet with the aim of reliably detecting hand gesture movements from brain signals. The results demonstrated that among selected neural network architectures, regular neural network was most effective with F1-score of 0.9973 and accuracy of 0.9973.
