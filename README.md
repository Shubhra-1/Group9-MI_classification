In the last few years, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) has grown as a very popular topic due to its application in rehabilitation and medical engineering. This interface refers to a system that allows a direct communication between the brain and assistive devices like electric wheelchairs, exoskeletons, artificial limbs, etc [1]. BCI works by translating the brain activities to operate several assistive devices, without any manual intervention. These brain activities are monitored using electroencephalogram (EEG) and are then classified to manipulate external devices [2].
